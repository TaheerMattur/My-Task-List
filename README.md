## Task-List ðŸ“‹
This is a Task list application, it allows the user to add tasks. The user's task list is stored in the localStorage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there. It also has a filter option that helps the user to find the completed and uncompleted tasks. It also has the "mark-completed" button to mark the done task and the "trash" button that allows the user to delete the task completely from the browser's localStorage.
